<h2>KiloWatt Animation Library README</h2>
<p>Copyright &copy; 2008 Jon Watte. All rights reserved.</p>
<p>
The second half of this file contains a programmer's introduction to 
KiloWatt Animation. Please read the entire file!
</p><p>
The KiloWatt Animation code is released under the MIT open source 
license, and you can use it free of charge in any project (commercial 
or not) provided that the license is followed. The license is 
included in this directory in a file called LICENSE.txt. The artwork 
is NOT licensed for further distribution (except for the .fx files, 
which count as code), and you can NOT re-use the art in your own project. 
If you want to purchase copies of the art for use in your game, 
the models come from http://www.3dbud.com/ and have been slightly 
modified and exported from 3ds Max using kW X-port.
</p><p>
This directory contains mainly some animation classes that will let 
you animation non-skinned (and skinned, see below) objects built in 
3ds Max and exported with the kW X-port plug-in. The classes may 
also work with other animated meshes, but this has not been tested 
and is not a goal of the project.
</p><p>
The contents of the folder is as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Pipeline
  <ul>
  <li>AnimationProcessor
    <ul>
    <li>The content processor you need to use for importing animated 
      meshes. Add a reference to AnimationProcessor and Pipeline to 
      the Content project in your solution.</li>
    <li>This processor reduces the animation key set based on a quality 
      measurement that you can tweak. Combined with the ability of 
      the runtime classes to interpolate between keyframes, this can 
      lead to enormous size savings compared to the XNA sample 
      animation components.</li>
    <li>Contains source for the Dxt5ModelProcessor that the 
      AnimationProcessor is based on. This processor fixes a bug in 
      the base ModelProcessor where DXT textures with full transparency 
      are made all black.</li>
    <li>Also contains some other classes that are not used in the animation
      project.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>tools
  <ul>
  <li>AnimationViewer
    <ul>
    <li>A simple test application that uses KiloWatt animation to show 
      and animate a mesh that you can select (one mesh is included).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Base
  <ul>
  <li>Animation
    <ul>
    <li>The classes that implement runtime animation. These classes 
      support simple animation blending and compositing, as well as 
      interpolation between keyframes (great for slow-motion, or 
      reduced data streams).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Graphics
  <ul>
    <li>Contains some utility classes for drawing graphics. Specifically 
      tuned to use shaders similar to the "model.fx" shader included 
      with the animation viewer. (EffectConfig and DrawDetails)</li>

<h2>Using KiloWatt Animation in your project</h2>
<p> 
To use KiloWatt Animation in your project, you need to do the following:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Add KiloWatt\Base\Base.csproj to your solution.</li>
<li>Add KiloWatt\Pipeline\Pipeline.csproj to your solution.</li>
   solution.</li>
<li>Find the "Content" project in your main project. Right-click on that 
   project and choose "Add Reference...". From the "Project" tab, choose 
   "Pipeline."</li>
</ol>
</p><p>
Now, you can add .X files (and, presumably, .FBX files) to your Content 
project, and select the "Animation Processor - KiloWatt" as the content 
processor for that mesh. When the mesh is built, any animation is 
extracted and added to the Tag dictionary of the Model. Here are the settings 
used for the archer.x model:
</p>
<img src='content-settings.png' />
<p>
The ForceShader and ForceShaderSkinned settings, respectively, allow you to 
specify a specific effect file to use for the parts of the model that are 
not skinned, or skinned, respectively. If the name starts with a "+" sign, 
then the rest of the name will be added to the existing effect name, instead 
of the effect name entirely replaced. Thus, the archer is modeled in 3ds Max 
using the "diffuseonly.fx" effect, but the built file will reference the 
effect "diffuseonly-skinned.fx". ForceShader also allows you to specify a 
given shader for materials that don't originally use shaders.
</p><p>
SampleRate sets the rate at which to sample each imported animation. This 
allows you to determine what level of precision you want, although higher 
sampling rates will use more disk and memory space. The processor will run 
keyframe reduction on the animation data, removing keyframes that are the 
same as the interpolated value between the two neighbors. This saves 
considerable space! There is some loss of quality allowed in this process; 
how much loss you allow is specified with Tolerance. "1" is a pretty large 
number for loss; "0.001" is intended to be imperceptible loss. "0" will not 
accept any quality loss in keyframe reduction, and will result in somewhat 
larger animation files (but still a lot smaller than the matrix based 
animation libraries.)
</p><p>
After you have loaded the model with Content.Load<Model>("your model"), 
you can get a Dictionary<string, object> from the Tag of the Model, and 
get an AnimationSet (named "AnimationSet") from that dictionary. The 
AnimationSet contains a collection of Animations. Each Animation will 
affect all the animated bones in the Model, based on time.
</p><p>
To use an Animation, you create an AnimationInstance. The AnimationInstance 
actually has a concept of "current time," as well as a concept of "speed" 
that lets you scale the animation to play faster or slower than normal. 
This is useful, for example, for walking and running animations. The 
simplest usage of AnimationInstance is to create one with a given Animation 
as argument, then call Advance(gameTime.ElapsedGameTime.TotalSeconds) each 
Update() call, and call CopyPoseTo() to copy the (parent-relative) bone 
poses into the Model inside Draw().
</p><p>
Then draw the model as animated, first calling Model.CopyAbsoluteBoneTransformsTo 
to extract the world-relative matrices, and then looping through each 
ModelMesh, setting the World matrix, and drawing the mesh (this is the same 
as for the animation sample, and pretty much any other Model drawing sample 
that doesn't use the simple Model.Draw() function).
</p><p>
A simple way of doing this is to use the ModelDraw class in KiloWatt.Base.Graphics. 
You can create one of these per model you want to draw, and then call Draw() on it 
to draw. This will also remember transparent parts of the mesh (based on annotations 
on the shader) and draw those sorted, last, when you call ModelDraw.DrawDeferred(). 
</p><p>
The ModelDraw class uses the EffectConfig class, also from KiloWatt.Base.Graphics. 
This class collaborates with the DrawDetails description class to set up shaders 
that are configured in a common way, implemented by the sample shaders included in 
the distribution. Sample shaders include:
</p>
<center>
<table>
<tr><th>shader</th><th>description</th></tr>
<tr><td>diffuseonly.fx</td><td>Render a model with a diffuse texture, using per-
pixel phong shading. You can configure a fog distance and a single directional 
light.</td></tr>
<tr><td>diffuseonly-skinned.fx</td><td>Same as diffuseonly.fx, but additionally calculate 
mesh skinning in the vertex shader based on a bone pose.</td></tr>
<tr><td>diffusexparent.fx</td><td>Render a model with a diffuse texture, using per-
pixel phong shading. You can configure a fog distance and a single directional 
light. This shader uses the alpha of the diffuse texture for blending, and marks 
the technique as transparent-sorted for EffectConfig to use.</td></tr>
<tr><td>diffusexparent-skinned.fx</td><td>Same as diffusexparent.fx with skinning added.</td></tr>
<tr><td>model.fx</td><td>Render a model with diffuse color mapping, tangent-space 
normal mapping (requires tangents to be exported from 3ds Max or similar), and gloss 
mapping (RGB for reflectivity, A for glossiness). Lets you specify fog distance and 
a single directional light.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>
See the AnimationViewer sample for more usage instructions.
</p><p>
A more advanced way of using the library involves using the AnimationBlender 
class, which will blend some number of animations at the same time, and keep 
them all progressing in time. You can smoothly blend over time from one 
animation to the next using TransitionAnimations(), or you can manually add 
some number of animations and change their weights over time. There are two 
kinds of animation blending: NormalizedBlend and Compose. First, all animations 
with NormalizedBlend mode are blended together, to a normalized "1.0" weight. 
Then, each Compose animation is added into the animation, with the weight 
given by its IBlendedAnimation instance.
</p><p>
The AnimationProcessor has some number of properties you may want to set. 
Chief among them is the ForceDXT5 property, which will force all textures to 
DXT5 format. There is also the DoAnimations property, which when false, causes 
no animations to be processed (convenient for debugging).
The ExcludeAnimations and ExcludeBones properties work more or less the same 
way; they are semicolon separated lists of regular expressions that will match 
the names of of animations or bones to exclude from the animation set, respectively.
There should be no spaces between the semicolons and the data. Note that these 
regular expressions are implicitly anchored to the beginning/end of the name, 
so if you want to match a substring, you have to use ".*" at beginning and end.
</p><p>
For example, if your file contains the three animations called "Run," "Jump" 
and "Idle," and you wanted to include only the "Idle" animation, you would set 
the "ExcludeAnimations" property to "Run;Jump" (or, for that matter, 
"Jump;Run"). Without the double quotes, of course :-)
</p><p>
The animation processor will currently generate two "special" animations, called 
"$id$" and "$bind$." The $id$ animation sets all the animated matrices to the 
identity matrix, which ends up putting all bones unrotated at the origin. The 
"$bind$" animation sets all bones to their initial bind pose, so the model will 
end up posed the way it was in the DCC tool.
</p><p>
The included art is NOT licensed under the MIT license. Especially the archer.x 
file is covered by a license that does not allow re-use outside of this current 
download. Please respect intellectual property rights of the artists who made 
the mesh and textures included. Also note that the original textures came in 
larger resolutions, but I have scaled them down to lower quality to avoid too 
large a download.
</p><p>
A screen shot of the settings used for kW X-port in 3ds Max when exporting the
archer mesh is included here:
</p>
<img src='archer-export.png' />
<p>
The shader materials were set up in 3ds Max using the DirectX Material, which is 
only available when you're using the Direct3D viewport manager. Also note that 
the fog settings need to be turned up a lot from the default setting, to avoid 
getting an all gray mesh.
